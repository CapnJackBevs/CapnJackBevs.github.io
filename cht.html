  <h1> Chromatic Homotopy Theory </h1>
  <p> 
    These Lectures are part of a series run by <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~cbarwick/">Clark Barwick</a>, 
    
    The idea behind the program is that the stable homotopy groups of spheres can effectively be filtered by the moduli stack of commutative, 1-dimensional formal group laws. Taking this idea seriously means developing a nontrivial connection between arithmetic geometry and homotopy theory.

    For format, what I'm proposing is that I (or we) talk about a bit of the story for an hour, and then we have a discussion about related ideas for another hour.

    Selfishly, I'd like to actually understand how all the pieces of this story fit together. I understand a certain narrative throughline, but there are a lot of related objects that I don't know. Some of that is on the homotopical side (e.g., the proof of Quillen's theorem, the patterns in the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, etc.), and some of that is on the arithmetic side (e.g., the proof of the Serre-Tate theorem, embarrassingly basic things about modular forms, how to look at the moduli of p-divisible groups, etc.).

    There's a lot to this story, and I can easily imagine deep rabbit holes we could, if we wanted, dive into. (There's a connection to pyknotic structures, to automorphic forms, and even conjecturally to quantum field theory, via the Stolz-Teichner program.) I'm happy to do a bunch of the talking ... at first ... if you can bear it.
