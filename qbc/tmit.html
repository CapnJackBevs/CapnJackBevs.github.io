  <h1> The Moon is Trans </h1>
  <h2> Jennifer Espinoza </h2>
  <p> The moon is trans.</p>
  <p> From this moment forward, the moon is trans.</p>
  <p> You don’t get to write about the moon anymore unless you respect that.</p>
  <p> You don’t get to talk to the moon anymore unless you use her correct pronouns.</p>
  <p> You don’t get to send men to the moon anymore unless their job is</p>
  <p> to bow down before her and apologize for the sins of the earth.</p>
  <p> She is waiting for you, pulling at you softly,</p>
  <p> telling you to shut the fuck up already please.</p>
  <p> Scientists theorize the moon was once a part of the earth</p>
  <p> that broke off when another planet struck it.</p>
  <p> Eve came from Adam’s rib.</p>
  <p> Etc.</p>
  <p> Do you believe in the power of not listening</p>
  <p> to the inside of your own head?</p>
  <p> I believe in the power of you not listening</p>
  <p> to the inside of your own head.</p>
  <p> This is all upside down.</p>
  <p> We should be talking about the ways that blood</p>
  <p> is similar to the part of outer space between the earth and the moon</p>
  <p> but we’re busy drawing it instead.</p>
  <p> The moon is often described as dead, though she is very much alive.</p>
  <p> The moon has not known the feeling of not wanting to be dead</p>
  <p> for any extended period of time in all of her existence, but</p>
  <p> she is not delicate and she is not weak.</p>
  <p> She is constantly moving away from you the only way she can.</p>
  <p> She never turns her face from you because of what you might do.</p>
  <p> She will outlive everything you know.</p>
