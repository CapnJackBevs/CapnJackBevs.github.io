  <h1> The Wednesday Lectures </h1>
  <p> 
    The Wedensday Lectures are a series of lectures run by <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~cbarwick/">Clark Barwick</a> on scheme theory, from a categorical perspective. 
    They will be run each Wednesday 16.00-18.00 (BST) from the 20th April 2022, to join the mailing list either fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/ttVV4US2u1kYciUW8">this form</a> or email myself at

  <h2> FAQ </h2>
  <h3> Why am I doing this? </h3>
  <p> 
    I'm really just scratching an itch. 
    Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the expansion of pure mathematics has accelerated rapidly, and on the "algebraic" side, 
    that's largely because of an influx of revolutionary new fundamental ideas and conceptual tools that have given us a language with which to ask and answer a entirely new universe of questions. 
    I have wanted to chart these new territories here at Edinburgh since I joined the department.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3> What are the topics? </h3>
  <p>
    They will be mathematics of a foundational nature from the past century in algebra. 
    The topics will change from time to time. 
    The first topic will be "Schemes." 
    The second topic will be "Higher Algebra." 
    After that, I'll follow the combined interest of the people who are showing up.
  </p>
  
  <h3> Will you talk about ...? </h3>
  <p>
    Maybe! If I know enough about that topic for it be easy to prepare the lectures, I'll be glad to.
  </p>

  <h3> Will you follow this textbook ...? </h3>
  <p>
    Nah. If something is already in a textbook, then the way for me to add value is to offer a different perspective on the objects in question.
  </p>

 <h3> Can my friend join? </h3>
  <p>
     Yep. All pleasant people are welcome.
